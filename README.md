Raspberry Pi ultrasonic parking sensor project


Use this to wire up your ultrasonic sensor:

I'm using a 330 and 470ohm resistor instead.

Here's the ultrasonic sensor you'll need, can also be purchased from ebay for much cheaper, but on the slow boat from China:

You'll also need one, two or several large LEDs, or alternatively you can use RGB LED, or even strips.


Configure your warn/stop and +/- threshold distances in the top of the script.
